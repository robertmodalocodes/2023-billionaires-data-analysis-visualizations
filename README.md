# Billionaires Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the Billionaire Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset file, `bill_stats.csv`, is processed and analyzed using Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) in this directory. Additionally, geographic data files (`georef-usa-state`, `tl_2023_us_state`, and `world-administrative-boundaries`) are used for mapping purposes.

The final output of this project is an interactive dashboard built with [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/). The dashboard application, implemented in `app.py`, provides insights and visualizations based on the processed data.

## Project Structure

- **Data Processing**: Conducted in Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`).
- **Dashboard**: Built using Shiny for Python (`app.py`).
- **Datasets**:

  - `bill_stats.csv` (Billionaire dataset from Kaggle).
  - Geographic data files for mapping.

## Setting Up Shiny for Python

- Install shiny for python instructions [here](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/install-create-run.html)
- Install shiny widgets instructions [here](http://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/jupyter-widgets.html)
- Install VSCode and the shiny extension for python [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=posit.shiny)
- Head over to [shiny for python documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) for full installation instructions.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all dependencies (check requirements.txt) are installed (e.g., Shiny for Python, Pandas, etc.).
2. Run the data processing notebooks to prepare the data.
3. Launch the dashboard by executing `app.py`.
4. For deployment, visit this [page](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/deploy.html)
